Your objective is to avoid getting hit by the 
baddies. To accomplish this, use the arrow keys,
"wasd" keys, and mouse to move around. Remember
that you can wrap around  the left and right edges
of the screen.

In survival mode, remember that once a distinctive
sound has been played, then you can activate a free
cheat by pressing either  the "c" key or by left-
clicking with your mouse.

You can always exit the game anytime by pressing the
"escape" key or by clicking on the close button. To
toggle the background music during gameplay, press
the "m" key.
